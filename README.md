# Spotter App for Business Location Ranking

The Spotter App is a tool that helps entrepreneurs and business owners evaluate potential business locations. It collects business details through a form, such as business name, type, location, target customers, and company scale. Upon submission, users can choose specific locations on a Leaflet map where they plan to start their business. The backend of the app then provides ranked locations based on sustainable factors, including nearby competitors' ratings and the number of ratings, using the Selenium package in Python with Flask. The frontend is built with React.js.
